# HTML & CSS
After a long time after my sixth class started HTML again very excited to revise or maybe learn new things as a part of #ProgateChallenege</br> 

# HTML

HTML is like it defines the Structure of the website/webpage like a frame which supports evrything</br>

.Tags</br>
.\<p\>\<\/p\> Paragraph Tag to include a para</br>
.\<h1\>\<\/h1\> Heading Tag increase the number to increase the size of heading</br>
.\<a\>Link\<\/a\>Links are created like this</br>
.\<a href\=\"https://github.com\"\>GitHub\<\/a\>defining links</br>
.Specifying class of the tag helps in CSS designing and organizing the tags for customization</br>
.\<meta charset=\"utf-8\"\> To define the encoding of the site and ensure our page displays corrrectly</br>
.\<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"stylesheet.css\"\> Link to the css file</br>
.You can add various /<div/> tags in body to define various calsses in the body</br>
.Suppose you want to modify only 'H' in Hello World then just add a span tag like <sapn>H</span>ELLO now customoze this span tag in CSS</br>
.<input> tag for taking input from the user no need to close the input tag</br>
.<textarea> tag for multiple lines of input</br>
.



# CSS

CSS Cascading Style Sheets is used to design the websites like colors and decor , I'm totally new to this :smile:

.Just mention the HTML tag and you can change properties or perhaps format them like color,background etc</br>
. As we go furhter there are many things you could do like setting width and breadth adding better looks to your page</br>
. Now using the class of any tag in HTML we can specify the color etc only to selected tags</br>
.You can just change/set colors and properties of whole body or h1 or any tag by just mentioning it's name</br>
.for li tag set *list-style*/:none; to remove bullets and simply display a list</br>
.set float property in list to set alignment like left or right</br>
.defiene padding induvidually like padding-top/right/bottom/left:10px; or simply padding:toppx rpx bpx lpx; </br>
.suppose you want to change the properties of list tag in the header tag you should specify as : *.header-list* *li* {}</br>
.You can add a border with the border property ,you can specify the thickness, style(solid), and color</br>
.Customise borders further like border-bottom, border-top, border-left, or border-right.</br>
.Add more padding inside and outside border for more beautiful looks for the page</br>
.Also do add margins like margin-top etc for adding margins on any side</br>
.we use opacity property to make an element transparent.</br>
.But the problem with opacity is that it makes the entire element transparent, including all the child elements.</br>
.If we only want the background color to be transparent, we can use rgba property.</br>
.Use the display property to display elements as blocks etc block,inline-block etc</br>
.Font weight normal,bold</br>
.Using hover properties and transitions</br>
