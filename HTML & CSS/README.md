# HTML & CSS
After a long time after my sixth class started HTML again very excited to revise or maybe learn new things as a part of #ProgateChallenege</br> 

# HTML

HTML is like it defines the Structure of the website/webpage like a frame which supports evrything</br>

.Tags</br>
.\<p\>\<\/p\> Paragraph Tag to include a para</br>
.\<h1\>\<\/h1\> Heading Tag increase the number to increase the size of heading</br>
.\<a\>Link\<\/a\>Links are created like this</br>
.\<a href\=\"https://github.com\"\>GitHub\<\/a\>defining links</br>
.Specifying class of the tag helps in CSS designing and organizing the tags for customization</br>


# CSS

CSS Cascading Style Sheets is used to design the websites like colors and decor,I'm totally new to this :smile:

.Just mention the HTML tag and you can change properties or perhaps format them like color,background etc</br>
. As we go furhter there are many things you could do like setting width and breadth adding better looks to your page</br>
. Now using the class of any tag in HTML we can specify the color etc only to selected tags</br>
